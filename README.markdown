# Embedding Sinatra in Rails

This is a simple app to demonstrate how to embed Sinatra in a Rails 3 application. Aside from taking the handful of steps necessary to embed Sinatra, the application is an otherwise vanilla Rails app.

You can find the associated blog post with implementation details [here](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/anachronistic/entry/embedding_sinatra_in_a_rails_3_application?lang=en).

Launch your application and browse to [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api) to see the Sinatra route executed.
